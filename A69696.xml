            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE many and eminent dangers occurring to this Kingdom of late years from its inteſtine Treacheries and Baſeneſs, have produced that Conſternation, and that Jealouſie in the minds of all good people, as render them diffident both of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir Friends and Fortunes, knowing no more which way to diſpoſe of their Eſtates, than their Affections: <hi>Terras Aſtrea reliquit, A Kingdom divided within it ſelf, can never ſtand:</hi> and this was our condition; when thoſe very men (the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Publick) who ought to conduct and ſtand by us in the day of Battel, have been the Perſons in the World moſt likely to betray us, and lead us up like Sheep to the Slaughter. Thoſe <hi>Danbaean</hi> Senators, from whoſe Wiſdom ſo much was expected; thoſe Penſionary Tribunes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the People, from whoſe Integrity ſo much was hoped, have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſecuring that Peace and Tranquility, that Religion and Property which all good men wiſh'd for, not only diſturb'd the one, but hazarded ruining the other; <hi>Quid non mortalia pectora cogit, auri ſacra fames?</hi> our Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> ſeems to be already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd, and we have every hour reaſon to expect the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould fling open the doors: And then, if two or three hundred <hi>Dutch</hi> Mariners could preſent us with ſuch Horrour and Apprehenſions, as we all know they did at their arrival in <hi>Chatham</hi> River, how much greater now will our diſtraction be, when an Army of fifty or ſixty thouſand <hi>French</hi>-men is Landed amongſt us! When the Father muſt forſake his innocent and prety Orphans, the Husband his diſconſolate and helpleſs Widow, leaving them to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64263:2"/>murder'd by the Papiſts at home, whilſt he himſelf by his own death is compleating the Tragedy abroad! Are you not yet ſenſible of your condition? do you not yet perceive your approaching ruine? Think how the <hi>French King</hi> ſhakes his <hi>Faſces</hi> over us, when at the ſame time the Treacherous <hi>Papiſt</hi> renders us naked to his correction! Think how entirely your happineſs depends upon our moſt gracious Soveraign's Life; and then reflect upon the many Attempts there have been to rob us of that Bleſſing! Think how many good ſufficient Houſe-keepers have no ſooner committed themſelves and Families to reſt, but by that dreadful noiſe of <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> (occaſion'd by ſome Jeſuitical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice) have been waken'd from their innocent ſlumbers, juſt time enough to behold their <hi>All</hi> conſum'd in a few hours, which they with the ſweat of their brows had been ſo many years acquiring! Think how your Trading's loſt, and at the ſame time your Charges encreas'd, by keeping up a ſtanding Militia in your own defence! Think how your ancient Apoſtolick Religion, (for the which your Predeceſſors have not fear'd to die) is now upbraided and threatned by the Idolatrous Superſtition of an old Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh worſhip, under new Names, <hi>viz. Popery!</hi> Think how your Magiſtrates are murder'd before your eyes, for ſupporting that Liberty and Property whereby alone you ſubſiſt! That Property which entitles you to ſomething you may call your own, which having enjoy'd your ſelf, you may bequeath to your Poſterity after you: That Property which ſatisfies your hunger and thirſt with wholeſom and ſubſtantial food, as good Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mears unknown to any in an abſolute Monarchy, under the degree of the Nobility: That Property which gives you wherewithall to protect your Nakedneſs from the violence of the ſeveral Seaſons: That Property which ſubmits your Taxes and Impoſitions to the will and diſcretion of your own Repreſentatives, who in all ſuch caſes have power to ſay, <hi>Hitherto ſhall you come, and no farther:</hi> Alſo that Liberty which gives the Subject of <hi>England</hi> a fair and equal Tryal againſt his King, the Tenant againſt his Lord, and the Servant againſt his Maſter; which preſerves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable the Rights of the meaneſt Peaſant, even in deſpite of the higheſt Prerogative; ſecuring both his Life and Fortune from all but the moſt juſt decree of twelve of his own Neighbours.</p>
            <p>When at the ſame time, your Neighbours in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other Popiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, have no other ſecurity either for their Eſtates or Beings, ſave the grace or favour of their Prince; which renders them and their Poſterity perpetual Vaſſals to the Crown. When in <hi>Sicily</hi> you may behold many hundred Acres of rich Soyl lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd, by reaſon of the vaſt Impoſitions laid upon them by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> When in <hi>France</hi> upon any Holy-day you may behold whole Troops of Farmers, begging the charity of Paſſengers as they travel along the Road. When their food and ſubſiſtance is, ſome coarſe Bran-bread, a few Onions, Roots, and Water: or if ever they become ſo wealthy as to purchaſe a ſmall Joynt of Meat, then preſently ſo much muſt be allow'd to their Prince for ſuch a prodigal debauch. When their Farmers have ſcarce Cloaths ſufficient to cover their Nakedneſs, being contented to go in Wooden Shoes, and all things elſe proportionable; ſo that they are in a much worſe condition, than thoſe Poor to whom we pay Collection. When they can call nothing their own, ſince you may often ſee all that they have, to the very Cloaths on their backs, taken from them by an Edict or Proclamation: and this for no other end, than to ſacrifice them to the luxurious deſire of Glory, (or rather deſtruction of Mankind) ſo inſeparable from abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. There you may ſee the poor Tenant ground to Beggary, betwixt the Tax-gatherers on one hand, and the griping Landlords on the other. There you may behold the Merchants, Tradeſmen and Artificers, paying exceſſive <hi>Gabels</hi> or <hi>Exciſe,</hi> almoſt as much as the Commodity it ſelf is worth, for every Egg or bit of Bread they put in their mouths. Their very Labours are not their own; their very Stocks are borrow'd of them (which is but a civil way of Robbing) without any hopes of ever being paid again either Principal or Intereſt: their Houſes expoſed to Free-quarter; and what not? Nothing is more uſual than to ſee a Nobleman, with a whole Train of Horſe and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ride over the poor peoples Corn when ready to Reap, and no man dares ask why they do ſo. Nothing more frequent than to have loaded Carts, Waggons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compell'd to retire and give way to any giddy-headed Coxcomb on Horſe-back, that claims but the Title of <hi>Chevalier.</hi> Theſe and a thouſand more inconvemences are incident to Abſolute Monarchy, and Abſolute Monarchy incident to Popery; which is the only Reaſon that renders this Religion ſo amiable in the eyes of Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64263:2"/>Now for you <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that in this Matter you are no leſs concern'd than the Commonalty, ſince the more you enjoy, the more you have to loſe: And I think you have no reaſon to queſtion, but that if once the Government of Parliaments be ſupplanted by the Sword, you would ſoon be reſolv'd into the Body of the Commonalty; for I never obſerv'd a Red-coat in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s ſtanding Army, that ever made any difference between a Lord's Houſe and the meaneſt Farmer's; neither do I believe, that if there were no Parliaments, the priviledge of Peerage would long ſignifie any thing. And as for the Gentry, I know no priviledge they could pretend to, why their Eſtates ſhould be leſs obnoxious to Taxes, than thoſe of the meaneſt Commoner; however, if they ſhould be more favourably dealt with, it is but the Prince's courteſie, which he may continue or abrogate at his pleaſure. Therefore the Concern is univerſal, and he who betrays it, is no leſs a Traitor to himſelf in particular, than to his Country in general.</p>
            <p>Having thus therefore expoſed thoſe misfortunes which ever attend upon Popery and Arbitrary Government, give me now leave to recommend to your more ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſome remedy, whereby you may at leaſt hope to aſſwage the grief, if not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the cure, of what you ſo much fear: And this can only be done, by ſearching to the bottom of our evils, <hi>Radicem petere,</hi> by retiring from the event to the cauſe, wherein, I fear, we may diſcover ſome Members of the late Long Parliament to have acted a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part, being themſelves the acceſſaries, but thoſe that choſe them the principals of all our preſent evils.</p>
            <p>As we now have, ſo heretofore all other Nations had their <hi>Ordines Regni,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> though diſtinguiſht by different Names; ſuch were the Fathers of Families, and Princes of Tribes among the <hi>Jews;</hi> the <hi>Ephori</hi> among the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> among the <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Forum ſuperbienſe</hi> amongſt the <hi>Arragonians;</hi> and now the <hi>Dyet</hi> among the <hi>Germans;</hi> all which in <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are comprehended under the Name of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> But however the original inſtitution of theſe were for one and the ſame purpoſe, <hi>viz. Salus Populi,</hi> the preſervation of the people, as being all Governments of the mix'd or <hi>Gothick</hi> Model; yet they have moſt of them loſt both their form and ends, for the which they were at firſt deſign'd, being ſubverted and degenerated, ſome into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, as part of <hi>Italy,</hi> others into Tyranny, as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> where, by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and addreſs of ſome of their late Princes, by the ſervility and folly of the Nobility and Gentry, by the ſuppleneſs, treachery and fawning of the Clergy; as laſtly, by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſtupidity of the common people, in thoſe Kingdoms where Popery had ſo long prevail'd, (in firſt giving up the power they had of raiſing Taxes, whereby their conſent to the making of Laws was quickly after thought unneceſſary) they are reduced to that paſs, that their Parliaments are only to execute that Law which the King himſelf makes, to raiſe that Tax which the King himſelf levies, having a propriety in nothing but their own ſlavery. So that <hi>England</hi> at preſent ſeems to be the only place, which retains its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive method of Rule by Parliaments, who (according to their firſt inſtitution) ſerve as Council for the King, and Advocates for the People; and this when duely executed, without any fraud or partiality on either ſide, may be properly call'd a mixt or limited Monarchy, wherein the King hath his ſhare in the Government, and (ſubordinate under him) the people theirs, being undoubtedly (when each move regularly within their own Sphere) the beſt Conſtitution for the good of both, that is yet extant in any part of the known World, provided it could always remain as it now ſtands, wherein we partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the good, without any of the ill of all other Governments. But when either ſome diſaffected Miniſter with the Prince, or ſome factious Subject with the people, ſhall out of their own private ends occaſion a ſeparation or different intereſt between them, then the Game being once begun, if the Court Suit turns up Trump, we hazard running into a Tyranny and Popery; if the peoples, into a Republick and Presbytery; both which evils proceed from one and the ſame venomous humour, only differing as the Plague and the ſmall Pox; where, in Popery as in the Plague the venom reſorts all into one <hi>Bubo</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> when in Presbytery, like the ſmall Pox, the malignancy or virulent matter is more diſperſt into ſeveral little <hi>Puſtles</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> which therefore renders it the leaſt dangerous of the two.</p>
            <p>I cannot but be ſenſible, that to commend to <hi>Engliſh</hi> men the preſent Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we live, and that wiſe inſtitution of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> (as it was anciently) or Parliament, (as it is now call'd) ſome may think as needleſs, as to praiſe the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neceſſity of the Air we breath; ſince as we owe our ſubſiſtance to the one, ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64263:3"/>ought we to attribute all our happineſs and well-being to the other; for that it is this Conſtitution, this conjunction of King and People, that hath in ſo many Ages preſerv'd us from being expos'd to the arbitrary will of <hi>one ſingle perſon,</hi> who though he may happen ſometimes to be wiſe, temperate and juſt, yet that is but caſual, ſince in moſt private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies there are ſeen two deſcents of raſh, prodigal, and voluptuous Heirs, for one that is ſober, prudent, and thrifty. It is this that hinders the Subject from being given up as a prey, not only to the will of the Prince, but (which is ten times worſe) to the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable paſſions and luſts of Favourites, chief Miniſters and Women, when inſtead of a Monarch, (who governs but in Name, as it often happens) be ruled like the ancient <hi>French,</hi> by an inſolent <hi>Major</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> who will be ſure to mind the private intereſt of himſelf and family, ten times more than that of the Prince, or the publick Good; or like the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> under a weak <hi>Grand-Seigneur,</hi> by the prevailing Concubine of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> who is perhaps her ſelf manag'd by no higher dictates than that of her <hi>chief Eunuch,</hi> or <hi>ſhe-Slave.</hi> I ſhould not ſpeak a word in a Subject ſo evident and perſpicuous, did I not obſerve the impotent Ambition of ſome men, who care not (provided they may trample upon, and domineer over their inferiors) how much their ſuperiors do the like over them, their ſouls (like moſt inſolent mens) being mean enough to ſubmit to it; or elſe through the ignorance and ſtupidity of ſome lazy inſignificant Gentlemen, who care not how things go, provided they may enjoy their Hawks, Hounds, or Bowling-green Meetings; and for Politicks, are govern'd by their <hi>more impertinent Chaplain,</hi> or Parſon of their Pariſh. Did we not (I ſay) daily ſee the deſigns of ſome idle, covetous and ſycophant Clergy-men, who like Ivy, though it cannot grow without the ſupport of the Oak, and yet will deſtroy it at laſt, do in private Parlours, over a glaſs of Ale, as well as in their Pulpits, over their Cuſhions, ſet up abſolute Monarchy to be <hi>Jure divino,</hi> declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the unreaſonable ſtubbornneſs of any Parliament, that will not give away the peoples money, and ſubmit themſelves to be fleec'd, as often as the chief Miniſter or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite thinks fit. They cry up the Prince like an Angel, ſo long as he will be their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, to whip, impriſon, or hang, all that are not of their flock; or refuſe to give up their ſouls, once again to be managed by an implicit faith, whereby in the meanwhile they might not be troubl'd with thoſe uneaſie tasks of Studying, Preaching and Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but may have nothing elſe to do only to live at eaſe, keep their Coach and Horſes, with a Curate to do all the drudgery, whilſt they are making their addreſſes above, by flattering and informing at ſome great Nobleman's or Biſhop's Table; or elſe if their parts reach ſo high, by ſome ſycophant Pamphlet or Sermon againſt the Government eſtabliſh'd by Law, they teach that men have no property either in their Lives or Goods, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Prince's pleaſure. It would be a tedious buſineſs, nor is it the deſign of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to repeat or anſwer all their ſilly futilous Arguments upon this Subject; it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to tell them, it can be eaſily proved, that the Inſtitution of the <hi>Wittena Gemots</hi> or Great Councils, were more ancient than Chriſtianity it ſelf amongſt our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors, and conſequently that the people had their Repreſentatives in thoſe Aſſemblies, before the Biſhops or <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy were ſo much as heard of in this Iſland; and that <hi>Tythes</hi> (their <hi>Diana</hi>) were granted by King <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> (<hi>Anno</hi> 885.) in a general Council of <hi>Earls,</hi> great men, and an infinite number of other <hi>Liege</hi> men of the whole Land: <hi>Vid. Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, fol.</hi> 348. This is but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> taſte of thoſe many preſidents, which have been collected by learned pens upon this Subject; therefore I ſhall ſay no more to theſe Gentlemen, but hope, that if ever their ſo much deſired abſolute Monarchy get uppermoſt, they may every one of them be obliged to maintain (as <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> made the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi>) upon free Quarter, a Trooper or Red-Coat at leaſt, to fight, as well as a Curate to preach for them, out of their fat Benefices and Pluralities.</p>
            <p>Since therefore at preſent we live under ſo happy a Government, where being ſecurely landed our ſelves, we behold the ſhipwrack of our Neighbours; and ſince notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goodneſs of our Gracious Soveraign, (who deſires nothing leſs than the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſubverſion of that Government, which as well by his Coronarion Oath, as by his own Lenity and good Nature, he thinks himſelf oblig'd to preſerve) there are yet ſome, who out of their own private ends, endeavour to remove our ancient Landmarks, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Popery and Slavery amongſt us. Since therefore it is ſo much the Intereſt of all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men to maintain theſe priviledges, convey'd from their Anceſtors through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations inviolable, upon which all our happineſs, ſafety and well-being depends, I think no man in his ſenſes but muſt confeſs, that the right way to maintain the end is to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64263:3"/>look to the means, and that is, by taking care what perſons they chooſe for their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, with whom alone they muſt truſt their Eſtates, Lives and Liberties. Now this Government by Parliaments, however according to its primitive inſtitution it was without exception the beſt of all others, yet as well in that as in Chriſtianity, there hath been found out ways of corruption, and that is when either they ſit too long, too ſeldom, or are too frequently diſſolv'd, for that too frequent diſſolutions are no leſs dangerous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than too long ſeſſions, nevertheleſs, it may be in the Elector's power to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of both, and that by making a good choice. Whereas if the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will ſell all that they have for a glaſs of Sack, or a pot of Ale, chooſing him that will give them moſt drink to day, though they knew him to be a perſon who will ſell both their Religion, Lives and Fortunes to morrow, then ſuch frequent diſſolutions muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ruine us; for that the honeſt Country-Gentleman, deſigning no other private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but the true ſervice of his King and Country, hath no reaſon, neither is he able, once in half a year to ſpend 4 or 500 pounds, only to purchaſe a place full of charge, trouble and danger, without any profit to himſelf, only to ſerve thoſe who put him to ſuch an unkind expence. Who ever knew a Coachman or Groom buy his place, unleſs he deſign'd to rob his Maſter's Bin? And the Caſe is the ſame; for no man can afford to bid ſo high, as he that deſigns to make money again of his place. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Proverb, and 'tis a true one, <hi>That he who buys Juſtice, must ſell it again.</hi> Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you put to charge in your Elections, blame him not if he makes money again of what he bought, for that you did not lend him your Truſt, you ſold it him, and what a man hath purchaſed with his own money, he may lawfully ſell again. Now that man who does wilfully give his Voice for a noted Kaave or Fool, does his endeavour to ruine both his Country, himſelf, and his poſterity, and to be as bad or worſe than the perſon he chooſes; when if the greater part of the Houſe be wiſer or honeſter, it is no thanks to him; and for his part, if none elſe were concern'd with him, it were no matter if he were made a ſlave to morrow, eſpecially ſince he cannot but be ſenſible how many have already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they would ſell their Country for a morſel of Bread; (for I look upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, though it be an Office or Penſion of 2000 pounds <hi>per an.</hi> as no better in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with that) ſo as if a conſiderable number of ſuch men ſhould get into the Houſe, (and we know that the children of darkneſs are wiſer in their generation than the children of light) in what a miſerable condition were this poor Nation in at this juncture of time? The old <hi>Lord Treaſurer Burleigh</hi> (who is thought to have been the greateſt Stateſ-man that ever this Nation bred) did frequently deliver as a Maxim, or rather as a Propheſie, <hi>That</hi> England <hi>can hardly be undone, unleſs it be by her own Parliaments,</hi> undoubtedly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, that all other oppreſſions as being wrought by violence, might perhaps by violence be in time ſhaken off again: Whereas when in a Parliamentary way we are undone by a Law, that can never be reverſt but by a downright Rebellion, becauſe the parties advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by that Law will never agree to the repealing of it; and a Rebellion is both ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and of ſo black a character, as men either rich or conſcientious will hardly engage in it; therefore no publick miſchief is ſo irrecoverable as that which is grown into a Law, and that cannot be impos'd but by Parliament. Wherefore as we tender our Religion, Liberties and Eſtates, we muſt (as much as in us lyes) chooſe a good Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſince there never was a time wherein we more needed men of wiſdom, courage and integrity, who will not quit their duty either for want of conſideration, for favour, reward, or fear. The firſt and ſecond of theſe Accompliſhments I ſuſpect not, for that in ſuch a numerous Aſſembly there cannot want ſome wiſe bold men, who will be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and animate the reſt: Therefore I need only ſpeak to their want of integrity, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from private Intereſt, which uſually proceeds either from fear of loſing what a man now enjoys, or hope of gaining what he yet has not. For though men may talk high, and keep a great noiſe with Conſcience, and Love to their Country, yet when you come to underſtand Mankind aright, (not as it ſhould be, but as it is and ever will be) then will you find, that private Intereſt is the ſtring in the Bear's Noſe; it is that which governs the Beaſt. Therefore by this obſervation we may gueſs, who are fitteſt to be choſe Members of Parliament, and who are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Avoid all ſuch as hold any Office of conſiderable value during pleaſure,</hi> they being ſubject to be over-aw'd. For although a man wiſh well to his Country, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying thereof knows that at the long run he miſchieves his poſterity, if not himſelf, yet the narrowneſs of mens minds is ſuch, as makes them more tenderly apprehend a ſmall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64263:4"/>preſent damage, than a far greater hereafter. Such men muſt of neceſſity be under a great temptation and diſtraction, when their Conſciences and Intereſt look different ways, eſpecially having obſerv'd ſome men turn'd out of their Employs, after voting for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Country. Therefore ſince theſe men know before-hand the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that attend the Truſt of a Member of Parliament faithfully diſcharg'd, 'tis very ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious and reflecting upon their honeſty, if any ſuch ſtand; and I think we are bound in charity, nor can we do them a greater courteſie, than to anſwer their Petition in the Lord's Prayer, Not to lead them into temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Suſpect all thoſe</hi> (men of ill repute) <hi>who in their Profeſſion or near Relations have any dependency upon the Court;</hi> for they (unworthily) gueſſing at the King by themſelves, are apt to vote right or wrong, as they imagine will moſt pleaſe the prerogative Party. And perhaps this fancy helpt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to that favour, which hindred him from coming upon his Trial the laſt Seſſions. It is a hard matter for a Courtier to pleaſe that Miniſter who ſupports him, and thoſe whom he repreſents at the ſame time; and if he endeavours to oblige both, he becomes ſuch an uncertain Weathercock, as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he pleaſes neither. Wherefore the moſt prudent and honeſteſt of the Courtiers are obſerved to decline being Parliament-men, for this very Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Suſpect all ſuch as ſpend much upon you in Entertainments at their Elections:</hi> for that (as I told you before) he who buys any Office, deſigns to make Money of it again. And then conſider with your ſelves, what Looſers you will be, if to laugh and be merry one day, the Perſon you chooſe ſhould give you and your Children occaſion to mourn for ever after! Think how juſtly the ancient Heathens may upbraid this baſeneſs of us Chriſtians, when, as they ſacrificed many of their Children, nay and oftentimes their own Lives for the good of their Country, ſo on the contrary do we ſacrifice both our Religion, Lives, and Country, for the pleaſure of one days debauchery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Shun all ſuch men as are deſperately in Debt:</hi> for they needing Protection from paying of their Debts, are ſo afraid of being diſſolv'd as makes them ſubmit to any thing, rather than be left to the unmerciful Rage of their hungry Creditors, who have ſo long faſted for their Money. For all ſuch Perſons (though ſome of them may be look'd upon as honeſt fair-condition'd Gentlemen, and good Houſe-keepers) are in danger of being tempted to repair the decays of their own private Fortunes, by the Ruine of the Publick. Moreover, the chooſing of ſuch broken Fortunes, undoes Trade, ruines whole Families, and I have known it drive many men (contrary to their own inclinations) to wiſh never to ſee Parliaments more in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Avoid all ſuch as have been known Favourers of Papiſts, or Relations or Friends to any of the Lords in the</hi> Tower; <hi>nay beware of any that ſhall be recommended to you by ſuch as are ſo,</hi> (let them be never ſo Great men in your Countries) unleſs you intend to have their Friends to be their Judges. For when any Perſon ſhall out of a private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his own, Elect or give his Voice for one who is either a Friend or Relition to <hi>Him</hi> that ſtands Impeach'd by all the Commons of <hi>England</hi> of High Treaſon, he does in ſuch a caſe, as much as in him lies, endeavour to deſtroy the Kingdom, by ſaving the Life of its Enemy; for that if all other Electors ſhould do the ſame, he might live to perfect that Ruine amongſt us, which otherwiſe he muſt leave unfiniſh'd: An Act no leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, than for a man to ſell a Pardon to him that murder'd his own Father! If this laſt moſt wiſe Parliament thought it reaſonable (as they did) to Vote <hi>him a Betrayer of the Rights and Priviledges of the Commons of England,</hi> who ſhould dare to plead at Bar in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> let not thoſe who chooſe his neareſt Relations and Friends for his Judges, think themſelves leſs faulty than he that ſhould have pleaded for him after the aforeſaid Vote, ſince the deſign of both is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaving of his Life. Therefore if any do ſo, may their ſhame be their confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Above all others chooſe not any of thoſe who have been juſtly pointed at by the name of Penſioners,</hi> as being the worſt and baſeſt of Traytors; who making ſhipwrack of all Honour, Honeſty, and good Conſcience, ſell their Votes for Offices, preſent Gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or conſtant Penſions. The firſt notorious brood of theſe Vermin, were in the Old Long Parliament call'd by the name of <hi>Self-ſeekers;</hi> but the late <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were in greater numbers, more voracious, and of more univerſal obedience, or as the <hi>French</hi> call it, <hi>Sans Riſerve.</hi> They by our late excellent Houſe of Commons, are for their <hi>Secret Service</hi> branded by the open name of <hi>Penſioners,</hi> which they will hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aw off, notwithſtanding the Parliaments diſſolution hath as yet reſcued them from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64263:4"/>other puniſhment. However, that the Populace might not ſplit twice upon the ſame Rock, my requeſt is, that before they go to any Election, they would peruſe Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi>'s Catalogue both of ſuch Perſons and Sums as he recollected in his memory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of his Books, which upon ſome weighty Reaſons (above us Vulgar peoples ſearching into) was denied him. Now this <hi>Penſionary</hi> Inſtitution of the Treaſurer's, was certainly of great advantage to himſelf, and moſt pernicious to <hi>England;</hi> for if he did really diſtribute ſuch ſums as is pretended, then he might in a ſhort time make and repeal what Laws he pleas'd; or if he did not diſtribute them, then to his own enriching he might by an untrue accompt, divert a vaſt Treaſure into his own Purſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly and Lastly,</hi> As for you Citizens, Burgeſſes, and Freemen of Corporations and Cities, I ſhall ſay but little to you in particular, more than what hath been ſaid already in general; only, <hi>whoever is unfit to be choſen Knight of the Shire, is likewiſe unfit to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a Burgeſs.</hi> Neither let the more ſpecious pretences of any man, (that ſhall promiſe to build you a Town-Hall, or relieve your Poor with Money, or out of his adjacent Woods) deceive you any longer; for if ſo, wherein are you better than your Horſes, whom you catch every day, and clap a Bridle into their mouths, only by ſhewing them a few Oats, which they are never like to eat. Even the very Mice are too wiſe to be taken by an old Bait, but will firſt have the Trap new baited, before they'l meddle; and yet I have known a Corporation, which has been taken twice by one and the ſame Bait. But however, ſuppoſe theſe men do really perform what they promiſe, what compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that, if the men you chooſe ſhould lay a good ſwinging Tax upon your Eſtates, without any real cauſe; or ſhould give up the very Power you have of Taxing your ſelves, or ſending your Repreſentatives in Parliament, (for one bad Parliament may ruine us) what good would the Money for your Poor do you in ſuch a caſe, more than when you were thereby reduced to Beggery, you might perhaps your ſelves (the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Country having no reaſon to relieve you) be forced to come in for a ſmall ſhare of this their Hypocritical Charity: An excellent reward for Folly. Neither ſay, Oh, this is but one man, and can have but one Voice; he will do our Town a great deal of good, and can do us but little hurt if he would. For that, firſt, one or two Voices have ſometimes carried a Vote of great importance: and ſecondly, you know not the bad example this may give to other Neighbouring Corporations, and if all ſhould do ſo, in what a miſerable caſe would you be? ſince the Voices of the Burroughs make two thirds of the Houſe. Laſtly, no man can tell the influence that one cunning talkative men hath over the reſt of the Houſe, eſpecially over thoſe that weigh Words, more than Reaſon and Senſe. But I ſhall ſay no more upon this ſubject, only deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſold his Birth-right for a meſs of Pottage, and could never afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, though he ſought it with Tears: Alſo, when once you had Elected ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Parliament, no Prince (but ſo juſt and gracious a Prince as ours) would ſuffer you to get rid of 'em in haſt, or at leaſtwiſe till they had done your buſineſs for you.</p>
            <p>Having thus therefore ſhew'd you what perſons you ought not to chooſe, ſo now in the next place, the more clearly to perceive what kind of perſons our preſent neceſſity requires to be choſen, conſider for what ends they ſerve; and they are two: One is, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Religion from Popery; The other is, to preſerve inviolable our Liberty and Property, according to the known Laws of the Land, without any introduction of that abſolute and arbitrary rule in other Countries, which we are neither to imitate or regard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore as near as we can gueſs, <hi>we ought to elect good Proteſtants towards God, and juſt towards Men.</hi> But foraſmuch as in this corrupt Age wherein we live, men are not ſo ſpiritual as they ought to be, it is not amiſs to ſeek for thoſe, whoſe ſpiritual intereſt is ſeconded by a temporal one. Wherefore the ſureſt Champions for our Religion againſt the Papacy, are our <hi>Abby-landed men;</hi> for notwithſtanding the regiſtred Diſpenſation to <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth from the Pope, for the ſeizing of thoſe Monaſteries and Lands, yet of late they pretend that the Pope had not power to alien them from the Church; wherefore the preſent poſſeſſors can never truſt or rely upon any new Promiſes or actual Grants thereof, eſpecially from him whoſe everlaſting and declared Maxim it is, never to keep Faith with Hereticks. Undoubtedly to make eaſie his aſcent into the ſaddle, he will proffer many fair Aſſurances and Grants; but if theſe Abby-landed men, be not the moſt ſilly of all others, they will never believe him; for when he is once firmly ſetled, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64263:5"/>will he with his Canon-Law diſtinctions, like Fire under Quick-ſilver, evaporate away all his promiſes, and violently reſume the Lands, glorifying his own Bounty, if he require not the mean profits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For our Liberty and Property, <hi>men of fair Repute in their Country, are of all others moſt likely to prove the ſtouteſt Patriots, eſpecially if in Poſſeſſion or Reverſion they are men of good Eſtates;</hi> for their Concern is the greater: And we find by experience of ſuch as travel into forreign Parts, where themſelves have no Eſtates, <hi>Facile habetur paupert as fine damne;</hi> and accordingly when War and Confuſion begins to ariſe, they apprehend it not with the hundredth part of that anxiety, as they would do if the like ſhould ariſe at home, where their whole livelihood is at ſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, and laſtly, I conceive it will not be amiſs, if for the moſt part you chooſe the ſame Members again that ſerv'd you faithfully the laſt time;</hi> ſince in ſo doing, you will both take off that fear of Diſſolutions, which is of ſuch fatal conſequence in a Parliament, as alſo oblige them to ſerve you more chearfully ever after, when you have ſo highly honour'd them twice. Which being all the Advice I can give you in this Matter, I ſhall conclude with deſiring you not to be weary of well-doing, neither to be alarm'd or troubled at fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prorogations or Diſſolutions; ſince if you perſiſt in the ſame ſteady courſe you have already begun, it will but fall more heavily upon the heads of thoſe, that are the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of theſe Miſunderſtandings between his Gracious Majeſty, and his moſt faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for whoſe happy union, as well in opinion as affection, none can pray more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than</p>

            <p>WHat I have here written, I do declare before Almighty God, proceeded merely from the earneſt zeal and deſire I had of ſerving my King and Countrey; hoping by this timely caution to the Vulgar, to procure ſuch Senators, as might add to the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of our beſt of Kings and Governments, ſuch as might keep the Ballance even, and prevent our running either into Tyranny and Popery on the one hand, or into a Republick and Fanaticiſm on the other: Such as might divert that Storm which threatens us, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that Peace and that Tranquility, which all men, who have either Eſtates or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies (like my ſelf) are bound to pray for; ſuch as might render to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Ceſar's,</hi> to God the things that are God's, and to the People the things that are the Peoples.
